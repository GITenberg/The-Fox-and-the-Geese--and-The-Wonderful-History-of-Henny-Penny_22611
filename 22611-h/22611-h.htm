<h2>
    THE FOX AND THE GEESE.
</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   <span class="sc">There</span> was once a Goose at the point of death, </p>
<p class="i4">     So she called her three daughters near, </p>
<p class="i2">   And desired them all, with her latest breath, </p>
<p class="i4">     Her last dying words to hear. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Mr. Fox,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I know, </p>
<p class="i4">     Who lives in a covert hard by; </p>
<p class="i2">   To our race he has proved a deadly foe, </p>
<p class="i4">     So beware of his treachery. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;Build houses, ere long, of stone or of bricks, </p>
<p class="i4">     And get tiles for your roofs, I pray; </p>
<p class="i2">   For I know, of old, Mr. Reynard&rsquo;s tricks, </p>
<p class="i4">     And I fear he may come any day.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Thus saying, she died, and her daughters fair,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i4">     Gobble, Goosey, and Ganderee,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i2">   Agreed together, that they would beware </p>
<p class="i4">     Of Mr. Fox, their enemy. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But Gobble, the youngest, I grieve to say, </p>
<p class="i4">     Soon came to a very bad end, </p>
<p class="i2">   Because she preferred her own silly way, </p>
<p class="i4">     And would not to her mother attend. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   For she made, with some boards, an open nest, </p>
<p class="i4">     For a roof took the lid of a box; </p>
<p class="i2">   Then quietly laid herself down to rest, </p>
<p class="i4">     And thought she was safe from the Fox. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But Reynard, in taking an evening run, </p>
<p class="i4">     Soon scented the goose near the pond; </p>
<p class="i2">   Thought he, &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll have some supper and fun, </p>
<p class="i4">     For of both I am really fond.&rdquo; </p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Then on to the box he sprang in a trice, </p>
<p class="i4">     And roused Mrs. Gobble from bed; </p>
<p class="i2">   She only had time to hiss once or twice, </p>
<p class="i4">     Ere he snapped off her lily-white head. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Her sisters at home felt anxious and low </p>
<p class="i4">     When poor Gobble did not appear, </p>
<p class="i2">   And Goosey, determined her fate to know, </p>
<p class="i4">     Went and sought all the field far and near. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   At last she descried poor Gobble&rsquo;s head, </p>
<p class="i4">     And some feathers, not far apart; </p>
<p class="i2">   So she told Ganderee she had found her dead, </p>
<p class="i4">     And they both felt quite sad at heart. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Now Goosey was pretty, but liked her own way, </p>
<p class="i4">     Like Gobble, and some other birds. </p>
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no matter,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if I only obey </p>
<p class="i4">     A part of my mother&rsquo;s last words.&rdquo; </p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So her house she soon built of nice red brick, </p>
<p class="i4">     But she only thatched it with straw; </p>
<p class="i2">   And she thought that, however the Fox might kick, </p>
<p class="i4">     He could not get in e&rsquo;en a paw. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So she went to sleep, and at dead of night </p>
<p class="i4">     She heard at the door a low scratch; </p>
<p class="i2">   And presently Reynard, with all his might, </p>
<p class="i4">     Attempted to jump on the thatch. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But he tumbled back, and against the wall </p>
<p class="i4">     Grazed his nose in a fearful way; </p>
<p class="i2">   Then, almost mad with the pain of his fall, </p>
<p class="i4">     He barked, and ran slowly away. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So Goosey laughed, and felt quite o&rsquo;erjoyed </p>
<p class="i4">     To have thus escaped from all harm; </p>
<p class="i2">   But had she known how the Fox was employed, </p>
<p class="i4">     She would have felt dreadful alarm; </p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   For Gobble had been his last dainty meat,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i4">     So hungry he really did feel,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i2">   And resolved in his mind to accomplish this feat, </p>
<p class="i4">     And have the young goose for a meal. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So he slyly lighted a bundle of straws, </p>
<p class="i4">     And made no more noise than a mouse, </p>
<p class="i2">   Then lifted himself up on his hind paws, </p>
<p class="i4">     And quickly set fire to the house. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &rsquo;T was soon in a blaze, and Goosey awoke, </p>
<p class="i4">     With fright almost ready to die, </p>
<p class="i2">   And, nearly smothered with heat and with smoke, </p>
<p class="i4">     Up the chimney was forced to fly. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   The Fox was rejoiced to witness her flight, </p>
<p class="i4">     And, heedless of all her sad groans, </p>
<p class="i2">   He chased her until he saw her alight, </p>
<p class="i4">     Then eat her up all but her bones. </p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Poor Ganderee&rsquo;s heart was ready to break </p>
<p class="i4">     When the sad news reached her ear. </p>
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;&rsquo;T was that villain the Fox,&rdquo; said good Mr. Drake, </p>
<p class="i4">     Who lived in a pond very near. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;Now listen to me, I pray you,&rdquo; he said, </p>
<p class="i4">     &ldquo;And roof your new house with some tiles, </p>
<p class="i2">   Or you, like your sisters, will soon be dead,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i4">     A prey to your enemy&rsquo;s wiles.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So she took the advice of her mother and friend, </p>
<p class="i4">     And made her house very secure. </p>
<p class="i2">   Then she said,&mdash;&ldquo;Now, whatever may be my end, </p>
<p class="i4">     The Fox cannot catch me, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   He called at her door the very next day, </p>
<p class="i4">     And loudly and long did he knock; </p>
<p class="i2">   But she said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Leave my house, I pray, </p>
<p class="i4">     For the door I will not unlock; </p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;For you&rsquo;ve killed my sisters, I know full well, </p>
<p class="i4">     And you wish that I too were dead.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; said the Fox, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really tell </p>
<p class="i4">     Who put such a thought in your head: </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;For I&rsquo;ve always liked geese more than other birds, </p>
<p class="i4">     And you of your race I&rsquo;ve loved best.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="i2">   But the Goose ne&rsquo;er heeded his flattering words, </p>
<p class="i4">     So hungry he went to his rest. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Next week she beheld him again appear; </p>
<p class="i4">     &ldquo;Let me in very quick,&rdquo; he cried, </p>
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;For the news I&rsquo;ve to tell you&rsquo;ll be charmed to hear, </p>
<p class="i4">     And &rsquo;tis rude to keep me outside.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But the Goose only opened one window-pane, </p>
<p class="i4">     And popped out her pretty red bill; </p>
<p class="i2">   Said she, &ldquo;Your fair words are all in vain, </p>
<p class="i4">     But talk to me here, if you will.&rdquo; </p>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there will be a fair, </p>
<p class="i4">     All the birds and the beasts will go; </p>
<p class="i2">   So allow me, I pray, to escort you there, </p>
<p class="i4">     For you will be quite charmed, I know.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;Many thanks for your news,&rdquo; said Ganderee, </p>
<p class="i4">     &ldquo;But I had rather not go with you; </p>
<p class="i2">   I care not for any gay sight to see,&rdquo;&mdash; </p>
<p class="i4">     So the window she closed, and withdrew. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   In the morning, howe&rsquo;er, her mind she changed, </p>
<p class="i4">     And she thought she would go to the fair; </p>
<p class="i2">   So her numerous feathers she nicely arranged, </p>
<p class="i4">     And cleaned her red bill with much care. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   She went, I believe, before it was light, </p>
<p class="i4">     For of Reynard she felt much fear; </p>
<p class="i2">   So quickly she thought she would see each sight, </p>
<p class="i4">     And return ere he should appear. </p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   When the Goose arrived she began to laugh </p>
<p class="i4">     At the wondrous creatures she saw; </p>
<p class="i2">   There were dancing bears, and a tall giraffe, </p>
<p class="i4">     And a beautiful red macaw. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   A monkey was weighing out apples and roots; </p>
<p class="i4">     An ostrich, too, sold by retail; </p>
<p class="i2">   There were bees and butterflies tasting the fruits, </p>
<p class="i4">     And a pig drinking out of a pail. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Ganderee went into an elephant&rsquo;s shop, </p>
<p class="i4">     And quickly she bought a new churn; </p>
<p class="i2">   For, as it grew late, she feared to stop, </p>
<p class="i4">     As in safety she wished to return. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Ere, however, she got about half the way, </p>
<p class="i4">     She saw approaching her foe; </p>
<p class="i2">   And now she hissed with fear and dismay, </p>
<p class="i4">     For she knew not which way to go. </p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But at last of a capital plan she bethought, </p>
<p class="i4">     Of a place where she safely might hide; </p>
<p class="i2">   She got into the churn that she just had bought, </p>
<p class="i4">     And then fastened the lid inside. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   The churn was placed on the brow of a hill, </p>
<p class="i4">     And with Ganderee&rsquo;s weight down it rolled, </p>
<p class="i2">   Passing the Fox, who stood perfectly still, </p>
<p class="i4">     Quite alarmed, though he was very bold. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   For the Goose&rsquo;s wings flapped strangely about, </p>
<p class="i4">     And the noise was fearful to hear; </p>
<p class="i2">   And so bruised she felt she was glad to get out, </p>
<p class="i4">     When she thought that the coast was clear. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So safely she reached her own home at noon, </p>
<p class="i4">     And the Fox ne&rsquo;er saw her that day </p>
<p class="i2">   But after the fair he came very soon, </p>
<p class="i4">     And cried out, in a terrible way,&mdash; </p>

<p class="i2">   &ldquo;Quick, quick, let me in! oh, for once be kind, </p>
<p class="i4">     For the huntsman&rsquo;s horn I hear; </p>
<p class="i2">   O, hide me in any snug place you can find, </p>
<p class="i4">     For the hunters and hounds draw near!&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So the Goose looked out, in order to see </p>
<p class="i4">     Whether Reynard was only in jest; </p>
<p class="i2">   Then, knowing that he in her power would be, </p>
<p class="i4">     She opened the door to her guest. </p>
</div>

<p class="i2">   &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hide you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in my nice new churn.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>
<small>THE</small>
<br />
WONDERFUL HISTORY
<br />
<small>OF</small>
<br />
HENNY-PENNY.
</h2>

<p>
<span class="sc">One</span> fine summer morning a Hen was picking peas in a farm-yard, under
a pea-stack, when a pea fell on her head with such a thump that she
thought a cloud had fallen. And she thought she would go to the court
and tell the king that the clouds were falling: so she gaed, and she
gaed, and she gaed, and she met a Cock, and the Cock said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And she said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Cocky-locky, the clouds are falling, and I am going to tell the
king.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>
And Cocky-locky said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, Henny-penny.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So Cocky-locky and Henny-penny they gaed, and they gaed, and they gaed,
till they met a Duck. So the Duck said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Cocky-locky and Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And they said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Ducky-daddles, the clouds are falling, and we are going to tell
the king.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And Ducky-daddles said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, Cocky-locky and Henny-penny.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So Ducky-daddles, and Cocky-locky, and Henny-penny, they gaed, and they
gaed, and they gaed, till they met a Goose. So the Goose said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky and
Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And they said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Goosie-poosie, the clouds are falling, and we are going to tell
the king.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>
And Goosie-poosie said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky, and Henny-penny.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So Goosie-poosie, and Ducky-daddles, and Cocky-locky, and Henny-penny,
they gaed, and they gaed, and they gaed, till they met a Turkey. So the
Turkey said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Goosie-poosie, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky,
and Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And they said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Turkey-lurky, the clouds are falling, and we are going to tell
the king.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And Turkey-lurky said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, Goosie-poosie, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky, and
Henny-penny.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So Turkey-lurky, and Goosie-poosie, and Ducky-daddles, and Cocky-locky,
and Henny-penny, they gaed, and they gaed, and they gaed, till they met
a Fox. So the Fox said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Turkey-lurky,
<!--Page 23 actually begins here ... close of paragraph moved up to keep together.-->
                                            Goosie-poosie, Ducky-daddles,
Cocky-locky, and Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<a name="image-0008"><!--IMG--></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>
And they said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Fox, the clouds are falling, and we are going to tell
the king.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And the Fox said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come with me, Turkey-lurky, Goosie-poosie, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky,
and Henny-penny, and I will show you the road to the king&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So they all gaed, and they gaed, and they gaed, till they came to the
Fox&rsquo;s hole; and the Fox took them all into his hole, and he and his
young cubs eat up first poor Henny-penny, then poor Cocky-locky, then
poor Ducky-daddles, then poor Goosie-poosie, and then poor Turkey-lurky;
and so they never got to the king to tell him that the clouds had fallen
on the head of poor Henny-penny.

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL</a>
